# TODO

- [x] Support return type definition to netcdf, numpy or maskedarray.
- [x] Support merge of files.
- [ ] Support late ifile, options and ofile entry.
- [ ] Merge files later and not at the beginning.
- [ ] Planting and late value entry.

> The commands can be saved into lists instead of direct transformation
of a new input value. This way I can edit the original Input, Output, and
Options right away ([click](http://derrickgilland.com/posts/late-value-passing-for-lazy-method-chaining-in-python/)).
